This is the source code by Tim Omernick for a Fireworks app he presented for the Stanford students 2009. [Tim's blog post about it](http://gamemakers.ngmoco.com/post/111712416/stanford-university-and-apple-were-kind-enough-to)

I posted it here because it had gone offline and it was asked for at [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1995583/looking-for-tim-omernicks-fireworks-iphone-app)

Cheers!
